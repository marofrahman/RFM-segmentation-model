# RFM segmentation model #
#### The aim of this project was to create a suitable customer segmentation model on exisisting user information to improve marketing efforts via personalised email recommendations. The choice of segmentation used was a modified RFM model. ####

Alongisde the GSOT of this project, the below KPIs were calculated for each segment to compare how customer behaviour changed over time:
* Average User Spend per Order
* Average User Frequency
* Average Customer Life Value
* % of User Opt-Ins

Below is a schema of how the customer base was segmented via RFM:

Score | Frequency | Monetary
:---: | :-------: | :------:
  1   |     1     | 0 - 33%
  2   | 2 - 9     | 33 - 66%
  3   | 10+       | 66-100%


Using this *modified* RFM scoring system we were able to segment the customer base and personalise recommendations for these seperate groups.

Below are the finalised dashboards used in the reports of the projects:
